<TITLE>  Jobs stuck in the queue get running now
<CONTENT> Many jobs, especially jobs with multiple query sequences, have stuck
in the queue due to failure of our computational node. All these jobs are
revived and will get running soon.

e.g. system rebooting, will be re-activated automatically when the system is
back.

<TITLE>  Frequent job submission failure problem is solved
<CONTENT>  The TOPCONS web-server has experienced a problem recently that single-sequence
jobs submitted from the web-page fail frequently. The problem was caused by
randomly wrongly loaded virtual environment and it has been solved. However, you may
still experience occasional job submission failure when the server is
overloaded.  If this happens, please try again in a few moments.
